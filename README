jQuery latLonSelector is a form widget for selecting latitude and longitude.
It will display a map below matched inputs on focus and fill in lat/lon for
any inputs in the same form named "latitude" and "longitude."

I'm putting this out there in a rather raw state in the hopes that a) public
shaming will motivate me to improve it, or b) someone more enterprising will
improve it themselves.

Usage:
  $('#some_text_input').latLonSelector();

Requirements:
  jQuery
  Google Maps
